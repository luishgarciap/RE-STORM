# RE-STORM: **Re**quirement**s** Trade-offs for self adaptation using Partially **O**bse**r**vable **M**arkov Decision Processes (POMDPs)

**RE-STORM** is a technique to support reasoning and decision making based on the trade-offs of NFRs by Self Adaptive Systems (SASs), and underpinned by POMDPs.

The paper results have been organized in three categories:

* System under Dynamic Context (folders DynamicContext_DC1 to DynamicContext_DC2)
* Other Service Level Agreements (SLAs) (folder Other SLAs)
* System Under stable conditions (folder _StableConditions)

Each folder contains the .json files utilized to generate the plots presented in [1].
