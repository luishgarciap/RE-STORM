# RE-STORM

**RE-STORM**: **Re**quirement**s** Trade-offs for self adaptation using Partially **O**bse**r**vable **M**arkov Decision Processes
(POMDPs), is a technique to support reasoning and decision making based on the trade-offs of NFRs by Self Adaptive Systems (SASs), and underpinned by POMDPs.
